"Road Warrior" Music Tour Management Tool by Brent Rusinow

Installation: use "git clone" to copy to your computer and then open in your preferred browser.

Technologies used: Node.js, Express, Postgres/SQL, Sequelize, AJAX, JQuery, JQuery UI, and Bootstrap,

Things to fix: Client timezone is not currently working with Heroku. Heroku allows its timezone to be set to one specific one but overwrites any attempt with moment.js.

Room for improvement: 
-adding multi-paneled today page with google places for food and coffee
-utilizing multiple user levels (admin, etc)
-allowing users to connect to see when friends are playing in the same place
-messaging/chat
